## 3. Clean Code Development

__Kill Useless Code.__ There is no code without a task left in the source files. Any piece of code can be run depending on the algorithm parameters.

__Delete Useless Comments.__ The source code is sufficiently documented on the module as well as function levels (dockstrings). Some comments throughout the code can fascilitate understanding of the logic. For example, in module `tools.py` in function `_rank_selection` the comments in the beginning of the function explain how the rank selection is to be implemented.

__Invest in a Precise Naming.__ Each module, function and variable name has a meaninngful name. E.g., module `tools.py` contains functions such as `create_population` (line 13), `selection` (line 54), `crossover` (line 78), `mutation` (libe 103), and others, which perfom corresponding genetic algorithm operations of the principle of a natural selection. They, in turn, have local variables such as `population` (line 31), `child` (line 101), `chromosomes` (line 118), and many others, which speak for themselves.

__Avoid Magic Numbers.__ This realization of the genetic algorithm utilizes two parents for reproduction (module `tools.py`). To avoid a magic number '2' in loops in functions `_proportional_selection` (line 131), `_rank_selection` (line 157) and `_tournament_selection` (line 189), a constant `PARENTS` (line 11) is defined instead.

__No Side Effects. Ensure that "Changes have Local Consequences".__ Refer to the point 9 below.

__Know and apply refactoring patterns.__ Visual Studio Code supports various refactoring [operations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring).

__Encapsulate Conditionals.__ Python allows compact readable conditions such as in the funtion `_within_range` (line 214) in the module `benchmark.py`.

__Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself.__ Example of automation of repetitive tasks and avoiding duplicated functionality can be shown as the use of the function `roulette_wheel` (line 68, module `utils.py`) in functions `_proportional_selection` and `_rank_selection` (lines 131 and 157 respectibely, in  the module `tools.py`).

__Favour Composition over Inheritance.__ The project's implementation is classless and, consequently, has no inheritance.

__Use assertions.__ The use of assertions can be found in function `get_scores` (line 9, module `benchmark.py`). The function inside `get_scores` may return `None`, if one of the condions inside them fails, which will lead to the assertion error.

__Source Code Conventions.__ The project follows the python source code conventions [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). To constatly monitor the naming conventions, Visual Studio Code allows to have [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) activated.

__Automated Unit Tests.__ Several untit tests have been implemented (file `tests_all.py` in the project's `tests` directory).

__Use Mocks.__ The implemented unit tests use mock-up objects. For example, function `setUp` (line 16, module `tests`) creates several mock-up objects to later test such a function as `_decode`.

__Functional Techniques.__ The project tries to follow the functional techniques. For more information, refer to the point 7 below.

## 4. Build Management

Building and packaging the python project is done with `setuptools`. Refer to `setup.py` file in the project's root directory for detailed configurations.

## 5. Integrate some nice Unit-Tests in your Code to be integrated in the Build

The unit tests are integrated in the `setup.py` file (line 22).

A build with the integrated tests is invoked by the following command:

``` shell
$ python setup.py test
```

## 6. Continous Delivery

The continous delivery pipeline is done with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/andrej-sch/genetic-algorithm).

![build](https://api.travis-ci.com/andrej-sch/genetic-algorithm.svg?branch=master)

Refer to the [config file](https://github.com/andrej-sch/genetic-algorithm/blob/master/.travis.yml) and [build history](https://travis-ci.com/andrej-sch/genetic-algorithm/builds) for more details.

## 7. Integrated Development Environment

The project was developed in Microsoft Visual Code. It comes with a built-in IntelliSense facilitating code development. On top of that, additional plugins for Python were installed, enabling debugging and automatic linting.

`Ctrl+K F` | Close Folder (project)

`F9` | Toggle Breakpoint
`F5` | Start/Continue Debugging
`F11` | Step Into
`Shift+F11` | Step Out
`F10` | Step Over
`Shift+F5` | Stop

## 8. Domain-Specific Language

__YAML as DSL__. The project utilizes genetic algorithm hyper-parameters being specified in YAML file as `parameters.yaml`. The file is located in the project's root directory. It is parsed by an external library [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/). The contents of the file are read in the module `algorithm.py` (line 189) and are further passed to the main function of the algorithm (line 192).

## 9. Functional Programming

__Side effect free functions.__ Examples of these functions can be found throughout the modules. In the module __`tools.py`__: functon `elitism` (line 35); functions `_proportional_selection` (line 131), `_rank_selection` (line 157), `_tournament_selection` (line 189), `_one_point_crossover` (line 216), `_two_point_crossover` (line 241) and `_uniform_crossover` (line 274) are not pure due to the random number generator component, but rather non-deterministic side effect free functions. In the module __`benchmark.py`__, the example of side effect free functions are `_decode` (line 73), `_function_1` (line 131), `_function_2` (line 145), `_function_3` (line 159), `_function_4` (line 175), `_convert_to_fitness` (line 191), `_within_range` (line 212). In the module __`utils.py`__: functions `dim_number` (line 28) and `chromosome_length` (line 48); the function `roulette_wheel` (line 68) is again not pure due to the random component, but a non-deterministic side effect free function.

__Higher order functions.__ The use of higher order function can be found in the module `tools.py` functions `create_population` (line 13), `_proportional_selection` (line 131), `_rank_selection` (line157), and `_two_point_crossover` (line 241). As well as in the module `benchmark.py`, functions `_function_3` (line 159) and `_function_4` (line 175).

__Closure.__ A closure can be found in the module `benchmark.py` (line 73), definition of the function `_decode`, which in tern returns the internal function. The closure is being called in the same module in the function `get_scores` (line 23).

__Anonymous functions.__ Anonymous functions can be found in the module `utils.py`, function `swap` (line 8) and  function `square` (line 10).
